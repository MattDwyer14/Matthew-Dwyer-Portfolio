                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm Matthew Dwyer, an MSci graduate in Mathematical Physics from the University of Nottingham. My academic journey combined rigorous theoretical research with hands-on experience in data engineering and analytics, which has given me a unique perspective on how data shapes the world.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
                    <p>With a deep love for technology and innovation, I am committed to transforming raw data into actionable insights. My passion for data engineering is complemented by my skills in cloud infrastructure, machine learning, and data visualisation. I’m continuously working to expand my expertise in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud-based systems.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Leadership & Impact</h3>
                    <p>During my time as President of the University of Nottingham Physics Society, I demonstrated leadership by spearheading initiatives like the "Frontiers in Physics" lecture series, securing funding for the Astronomy initiative, and working with academic staff on new curriculum development.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                    <p>I’m always looking for opportunities to solve complex problems and make a difference through data. Whether it's through professional projects, collaborations, or self-driven challenges, my goal is to apply my technical skills in impactful ways.</p>
