                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Hi, I’m Matthew Dwyer, a Data Engineer with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. 
                        I graduated with an MSci in Mathematical Physics from the University of Nottingham, which has given me a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. 
                        Currently based in London, I’m always looking to expand my knowledge in Data Engineering, Machine Learning/AI, and Backend Engineering. With a strong technical background and a love for continuous learning, I’m dedicated to solving complex challenges with innovative data solutions. 
                        Outside of work, you’ll often find me exploring the latest in tech, improving my coding skills, or working on personal projects to push my understanding further. Welcome to my personal space on the web, where I’ll be sharing my journey, projects, and what I’ve been learning along the way.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
                    <p>With a deep love for technology and innovation, I am committed to transforming raw data into actionable insights. My passion for data engineering is complemented by my skills in cloud infrastructure, machine learning, and data visualisation. I’m continuously working to expand my expertise in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud-based systems.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                    <p>I’m always looking for opportunities to solve complex problems and make a difference through data. Whether it's through professional projects, collaborations, or self-driven challenges, my goal is to apply my technical skills in impactful ways.</p>
